# Bet365 Interview Task

This task was developed using vscode as editor and with live-server extension. Hence there is no server files provided.

Approach:

- Using HTML5 web components (custom components for graph-info and graph-info-list) were created using Javascript Classes to display compnay ids (ex: GOOG) and there respective colors on the graph.
- A TableElement and a tableRow Element were extended as web component for displaying and updating text data.
- A plain javascript class was written to display gragh.
- A Map Class was extened to store data and then server to the Table component (smart-table) and Canvas.

Not to over complecate thing but a server side event or an websocket can be used to update DOM from the server. Also using Observer pattern or Event driven approach along with web workers can make this little task more lively and slick.
 
 I would realy like to have a feedback and looking forward to it :).

I hope i have covered all the required object. Thank you for this opportunity.
