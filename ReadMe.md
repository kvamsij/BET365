# Bet365 Interview Task

This task was developed using vscode as editor and with live-server extension. Hence there is no server files provided.

Approach:
- Using HTML5 web components (custom components for graph-info and graph-info-list) were created using Javascript Classes to display compnay ids (ex: GOOG) and there respective colors on the graph.
- A TableElement and a tableRow Element were extended as web component for displaying and updating text data.
- A plain javascript class was written to display gragh.
- A Map Class was extened to store data and then server to the Table component (smart-table) and Canvas.
